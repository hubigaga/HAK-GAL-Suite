# HAK-GAL-Suite
HAK-GAL-Suite is a neuro-symbolic framework for verifiable knowledge extraction. It uses an LLM-based NL2Logic module to convert text into formal HAK/GAL formulas, a RAG pipeline for context retrieval, a Lark-based logic firewall, a multi-stage prover ensemble (pattern matcher + Z3), interactive clarifications and caching for performance.
